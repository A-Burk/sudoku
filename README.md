# Sudoku Solver Program Written in Python
## A functioning python program that uses recursion to solve sudoku puzzles.
This project is something I wanted to do mostly to have something on my Github. This project also serves as a fun exercise to get more familiar with python. For now, the code simply solves one of four sudoku puzzles I hard-coded in and spits out the solution or a "Not Solvable" message in the case that it is asked to solve the one unsolvable puzzle I wrote in. I would like to eventually build on this project more with additional features like:
* A graphical user interface
* A way to play sudoku
* A way to create/save puzzles
* A sudoku puzzle generator
* Quality of life features
* Scores based on time/mistakes
* Save data/progress tracking

## How to build on this project for your own uses
This is a pretty basic project. In it's current state, I would recommend you just make your own. If you wish to use it anyways, I recommend you clone and rename this project.

If you would like to know how to make this project yourself, I recommend that you:
1. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=6715s">this video</a> which explains how to make this project
2. Recreate the project from memory
3. Use my list of future feature additions as inspiration for improvements to your project

## Known issues (work in progress)
This program is very basic, has no user interaction, and is also lacking in originality. These problems will go away as I continue working on the project.
